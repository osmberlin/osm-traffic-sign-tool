# OSM Traffic Sign Tool 2 â€“ Beta

- A webapp to match traffic signs to OpenStreetMap tags
  [trafficsigns.osm-verkehrswende.org](https://trafficsigns.osm-verkehrswende.org)

- A npm package transform OSM traffic sign values to traffic sign object (and more)
  [npmjs.com/package/@osm-traffic-signs/converter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@osm-traffic-signs/converter)

### Project status

- See https://github.com/osmberlin/osm-traffic-sign-tool/issues/40

### Design decisions

- The tool gives recommendations; mappers still have to verify.
- If a sign has multiple values / spellings recommend one and rewrite the result accordingly.
- The tool recommends the official ID for most signs that are listed in the law.
- The tool recommends the ID plus bracked notation for less common signs that are mentioned in the law with an undefined list IDs.
  See [countryAlternativeKeyFormats.ts](./packages/traffic-sign-converter/src/data-definitions/countryAlternativeKeyFormats.ts) for more.
- Unknown signs are listed in the UI and `traffic_sign` value but they are not part of the tagging recommendations.
- To generate tag recommendations signs are first split in groups of primary and modifier signs. Modifications are applied per group.
- Only the latest ID of a sign is knows. Signs IDs that where reassigned in the past are not handled in a special way.

Limitations:

- Using more than one modifying sign will result in imprecise tagging recommendations.
- See Github Issues for more.
