# About

The main file is [trafficSigns.ts](../trafficSigns.ts). I want to validate the strucutre of this file using TypeScript. However, to make it easier to consume, the [trafficSigns.json](./trafficSigns.json) is generated on each build.

We could change this setup to use JSON Schema, but I don't see any advantage to this.
