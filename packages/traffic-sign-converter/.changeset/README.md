## Status quo

This only handles this one package.

[The app Changelog](apps/traffic-sign-tool/CHANGELOG.md) is managed manually, due to issues while setting up the changeset tooling as part of the Monorepo.

The issue is â€¦ which might relate to https://github.com/changesets/changesets/discussions/1158 but might also be a missconfiguration.

> ðŸ¦‹ error The package "osm-traffic-sign-tool" depends on the skipped package "@internal/taginfo" (either by `ignore` option or by `privatePackages.version`), but "osm-traffic-sign-tool" is not being skipped. Please pass "osm-traffic-sign-tool" to the `--ignore` flag.
